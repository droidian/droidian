Droidian
========

Droidian is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian for mobile devices.

The goal of Droidian is to be able to run Debian on Android phones.

This is accomplished by using well-known technologies such as [libhybris](https://github.com/libhybris/libhybris) and [halium](https://halium.org).

Droidian currently supports devices released with Android 8.1 or later (devices with a vendor partition also known as treble compatible).

Experimental support is also there for devices released with lower Android versions but with a Halium 9 port

A list of documented information can be viewed at the [Droidian wiki](https://github.com/droidian/droidian/wiki)

The device page is available at [devices.droidian.org](https://devices.droidian.org)

Device-specific sources are available at [droidian-devices](https://github.com/droidian-devices)

The porting guide is available at [porting-guide](https://github.com/droidian/porting-guide)


### Getting community help

The Droidian telegram group (also bridged to Matrix) is a great resource. It's quite possible that your issue has been already discussed and resolved.

Please use the search function rather than ask straight away. Discussing the same things at length is boring especially when it has been already done in the past.

If you can't find an answer for your issue, try to be as detailed as possible (include a pastebin of your logs). When someone is available, they will try to help you out.

Note that no one owes you an answer, avoid pinging people repeatedly. Avoid posting screenshots of text messages, use a pastebin service instead.
